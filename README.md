# Fraud-Detection

### Xente Fraud Detection Challenge

#### Introduction
Xente is an e-payments, e-commerce, and financial services company in Uganda offering various products and services that can be paid for using Mobile Money (Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money), Bank Card (Visa Card, Master Card), Xente wallet and on credit (Pay Later). Some of the products consumers can buy include airtime, data bundles, pay water and electricity bills, TV subscription services, buy event tickets, movie tickets, bus tickets, and more.

#### Goal
The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

#### Data
Xente is an e-commerce and financial service app serving 10,000+ customers in Uganda. The data used in this competition is the sole property of Zindi. This dataset includes a sample of approximately 140,000 transactions that occurred between 15 November 2018 and 15 March 2019. One of the challenges of fraud detection problems is that the data is highly imbalanced.
